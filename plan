Everything in here is subject to change it's just my thoughts over the last day or so
Decide on DB layout
  -basic user details table
  -sessions table (for tracking who's logged in and such)
  -game data like the player's servers reside in another table
  -NPCs get their own table
    -resetting them needs extra data, can just pull from database rather than hardcoding it, more flexible that way and easier to modify. 
      -maybe a "defaultNPC" table alongside the active "NPC" table?
# Create utility PHP functions for interacting with the database etc that can be imported to .
  -general tools
    -clean input text?
    -more things I haven't thought of yet
    
  -user tools (doing some of this now)
    -check user exists
      -by name
      -by email
    -create user
      -need to create game data immediately or when they actually go to the game?
        -second option might make it easier on round resets, just delete all the player game data and regenerate it when they log in
    -delete user
      -remember to delete their game data too
    -sessions
      -login
      -logout
      -check status of login
        -automatic logout
          -dependant on some 'keep me signed in' checkbox?
    
  -game logic tools
    -linking between user table and game data
    -idk this is far down the line from now I'll burn that bridge when I get to it
